# Minified Spotify Wrapped
This tool written in Java 17 will give you a tiny overview of how your Spotify Wrapped looks like currently.
It is a simple CLI that shows you:

- Total time listened this year;
- Time listened per artist of your top 10;
- Time listened per track of your top 10.

It calculates this data based on the data that Spotify has collected from you.
You can request this data [here](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/), or, if the shortcut doesn't work, copy and paste the following link in your browser: https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/

## How to use
1. Download Java 17 LTS and set up your machine so that its runtime configuration is set to Java 17.
2. Download your Spotify data [here](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/). This may take up to 30 days according to Spotify.
